# Java Scala Util: Introducing some of the core concepts of Scala into Java

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/pnerg/java-scala-util](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/pnerg/java-scala-util?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

One might ask the question why bother to map some of the features in Scala to Java.

Why not use Scala?
If you like me walk between the Java/Scala you'll miss some of Scala's features when programming in pure Java. 
It's for these situations this project has been created. To allow plain Java users use some of goodies in Scala but without actually using Scala. 

The project will supply features such as:
* Option/Some/None
* Try/Success/Failure
* Either/Left/Right
* Future/Promise
